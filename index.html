              I am an incoming Master's student at Arizona State University,
              specializing in Computer Science. My academic foundation was built
              at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute in India, where I
              graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Information
              Technology. My most recent position was as a Senior Software
              Engineer at Samsung Research.
